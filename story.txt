Bob was driving in a Porsche down the highway.
Bob was driving fast to make it to the flughafen on time for his flight to Berlin.
He was driving so fast, in fact, that he dropped his bratwurst between his lederhosen braces.
While reaching for his bratwurst, Bob had an accident, running his Porsche into the klimaanlage equipment of the Hauptstrasse Baeckerei where Gretchen was making hase und hund shaped apfelkuchen gebaeck for the wettbewerbsfaehig dirndel dance at Schloss Eltz.
Thankfully, he had another bratwurst in his wallet. 
Bob took out the bratwurst from his wallet, and just as he was about to take a bite a hund snatched from him.
